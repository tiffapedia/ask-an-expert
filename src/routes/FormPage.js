In the Form page, when the user clicks the Cancel button from the bottom of the page, 
they should be taken back to the Landing page.

In the Form page, the What you searched for input should be prefilled with the search query 
top account regions ranked by total amount booked and should not be permutable.

In the Form page, after the user enters the details in the text area and press the Send button, 
their input should be logged (for the sake of this exercise, you can send it to an Alert function instead). 
Then the Form is replaced with the Thank you page.
